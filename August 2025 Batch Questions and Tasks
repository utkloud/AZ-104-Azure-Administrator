What is Azure Load Balancer?
	Azure Load Balancer is a fully managed load balancing service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple resources (such as virtual machines) to ensure high availability, reliability, and scale.
What are the two types of Azure Load Balancers, and how do they differ?
	Azure offers two types of Load Balancers: Azure Standard Load Balancer and Azure Basic Load Balancer. The main difference is that Basic Load Balancer is designed for a single availability set, while Standard Load Balancer can be used with both availability sets and availability zones for higher availability.
What are the key benefits of using Azure Load Balancer?
	Azure Load Balancer provides high availability, fault tolerance, and improved performance for applications. It also offers distribution of incoming traffic, health monitoring, and support for various protocols.
What is the difference between Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Load Balancer?
	Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic management service used for routing client requests to specific endpoints. Azure Load Balancer, on the other hand, distributes network traffic at the transport layer (Layer 4) among resources within a data center.
How does Azure Load Balancer handle traffic distribution?
	Azure Load Balancer uses a 5-tuple hash (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol) to distribute incoming traffic across healthy resources.
What types of Load Balancers are available for virtual machines in Azure?
	Azure offers two types of Load Balancers for virtual machines: Azure Internal Load Balancer (ILB) for private, internal load balancing, and Azure Public Load Balancer for public-facing applications.
What is the difference between an Azure Load Balancer rule and a probe?
	An Azure Load Balancer rule defines how traffic should be distributed, based on the 5-tuple hash. A probe, on the other hand, is used to check the health of resources and ensure traffic is only directed to healthy instances.
How does Azure Load Balancer help in ensuring high availability for applications?
	Azure Load Balancer can distribute traffic across multiple healthy virtual machines, ensuring that even if one virtual machine becomes unhealthy, traffic is redirected to the remaining healthy instances, minimizing downtime.
Can Azure Load Balancer be used with both virtual machines and virtual networks?
	Yes, Azure Load Balancer can be used to distribute traffic to both virtual machines and virtual networks, making it a versatile load balancing solution.
What are the common protocols supported by Azure Load Balancer?
	Azure Load Balancer supports common protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.


• What is the purpose of a backend pool in Azure Load Balancer?
• What is session persistence in Azure Load Balancer?
• How does a Standard Load Balancer handle availability zone redundancy?

• What metrics and logs are available for monitoring Azure Load Balancer?
• What is Azure Application Gateway, and at which OSI layer does it operate?
• What is the difference between Application Gateway and Load Balancer?
• What is a Listener in Application Gateway?
• What is the role of a Backend HTTP Settings configuration?
• What are the differences between Basic, Multi-Site, and Path-based routing?
• How does Application Gateway handle SSL/TLS termination?
• What is Web Application Firewall (WAF) mode in Application Gateway?
• What is autoscaling Application Gateway, and when should it be used?
• What is Azure Front Door, and what layer does it operate on?
• How does Azure Front Door differ from Application Gateway?
• What routing methods are supported by Azure Front Door?
• What is Azure Traffic Manager, and how does it route client traffic?
• What are the different routing methods available in Traffic Manager?
• Can Traffic Manager route traffic to non-Azure endpoints?
